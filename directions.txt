-- functional network clustering --

Find connection hubs -- affinity between voxel X and voxel Y is the
number of connecting fibers
  - we can group voxels for less computational/spatial demand
  - optionally count only (near) end-point connections or any voxels
    visited along the way

Problem: cannot run group analysis with AP results.
However, could still reduce it to tractable smaller set that can be manually paired.

Identifying connection hubs could make healthy/disease connectivity
studies more tractable later by reducing to a few dozen pairwise
analyses.




-- filtered SH tractography --

Linear Kalman filtering of coefficients.
Max provides SH peak detection.



-- particle filtering --

UKF for local model
 - just run back-forth for small segment
PF for global path, sampling



helicoid model
UKF estimation
(why use PF to estimate?)
